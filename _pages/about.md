A highly technical Software Engineer specializing in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Architecture. 
I am driven by interesting challenges and constantly seek to further my own skills in areas of interest
including Big Data, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Distributed Computing, Computer Vision, AI,
IoT, Infrastructure, and more. I am an advocate of clean code and functional design principles and hold
myself and those I work with to the highest of standards. Having worked within both large and small
organisations, I am now building out Manta Innovations Ltd as a software consultancy and looking for
friendly clients with interesting problems that we can assist with solving.
