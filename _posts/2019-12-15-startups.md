Start-ups - Don't believe the hype
I'd like to preface this by saying I don't want this to be read as is a rant against start-ups, because I had a lot of 
fun whilst working with one, but I definitely went into it with rose tinted glasses and got slightly burnt, and as a 
result wanted to share some of my learnings.

For a bit of background, I spent a year working with a medium size start-up (approx. 50 employees) as a Senior Python 
Developer. Prior to that I'd spent 3 years working my way from Junior Developer up to Senior Data Scientist at a large 
consultancy. During my time at the consultancy I had specialised in Data Science and Data Engineering with Python and a 
little Scala. Given my lack of traditional CS background (my background is in Mathematics), and my main exposure to 
start-up culture from shows like Silicon Valley, I always consisted myself "not good enough" to work at a start-up. 
I considered them reserved for programming elite, the kind of 10x developers you hear about in hushed whispers. 
So naturally when I got the opportunity to join a start-up as a Senior Python Developer I jumped at the chance, though 
with a lot of trepidation to what I has signed myself up to. These are some things I learnt in my time there, and some 
things I wish I had known before.

### Start-ups are not just for the elite
On my first day at the start-up I found myself review a repository scattered with global variables. Literally, the first 
line of code I read was a long list of global declarations. Most annoyingly these were completely unnecessary, and could 
be easily refactored away. I found myself thinking, how could this be, start-ups were for experience software developers 
that knew this was not how to write sustainable code. It turned out this code had been written by a Data Scientist 
within the company who had come straight from university a few years ago - they didn't have any real world development 
experience. This is when it hit me, start-ups contain everything from inexperienced graduates through to seasoned 
veterans. I quickly realised that my concerns over being "good enough" and impostor syndrome were misplaced. *In short 
if you want to work for a start-up, go for it, you'll be fine.*

### You'll learn a lot if you listen
As I already listed, due to the varying talent startups employ, you're bound to find yourself talking to people with 
vastly different programming backgrounds to you. This means they'll have a wealth of experience that you may not have
explored yourself. For example, in my time there I met a Javascript developer who had just finished a React bootcamp, 
a Python developer who used to write desktop applications using PyQt, an ex-Java developer who used to work at Lehman
Brothers prior to the financial crash, an ethical hacker turned cloud native DevOps engineer who used to be an optometrist, 
a Python & Angular dev who was trying to build his own football startup on the side, a young Scala dev who had spent a 
year working for a bank before calling it quits, a Rust aficionado, a Gopher, and many more. All of these people had
come from different backgrounds, with different experiences, and different takes on things. *I learnt a lot about
different languages and design patterns by simply listening.*

### Move fast and break things just ends up with broken systems
We've all heard the Facebook mantra before - *"Move Fast and Break Things"*...its bullshit, and worse its considered to
be an ideal to aim for. I saw this time and time again, management, project managers, "scrum masters" (I'll save it for
a separate rant, but I don't believe in full time scrum masters), product owners, and HR. They had all seen the monoliths
of Facebook and Google evangelising the attitudes of *"Move Fast and Break Things"* and becoming the tech giants that 
they are. They considered it how *agile* should be done, the problem with this is that they weren't interested in fixing
systems once they broke them, and we just started crippling ourselves with technical debt. In one case the sales team
had signed a deal with a client for a type of configuration that we didn't, or couldn't, support due to a fundamental
concept the whole architecture had been designed around years prior, which they were now saying didn't apply. To correctly
re-architect the system to account for this one client would have taken months of work and careful re-write. Despite 
stressing this all the way up to the CEO, it was pushed through, but not with the substantial re-write, they wanted it 
done quickly, even though they knew it was incorrect and would cause other issues in downstream systems. We managed to
do it via a nasty hack and hardcoding this customer into the system, but on the understanding that sales would not sell
this type of deal again. Of course we were never given the space to go back and fix this hack properly due to other 
projects being pushed forward, but we knew it was there...then sales sold it again, and again. To my knowledge someone
is now manually hardcoding all those clients into the system, *we moved fast, we broke that system, we never fixed it*.

### Good startups do one thing right
Leading on from my previous point, with the knowledge that *"Move Fast and Break Things"* is just bullshit, yet still
facing this attitude from all angles everyday, I started looking for a different design philosophy, not one that was 
being splashed all over crunchbase or hackernews. I looked back at the startups that were evangelising the *MF;BT* (
Move Fast; Break Things - I'm getting tired of writing it) approach and instead looked at why they were so successful.
Facebook, Google, Uber, Spotify; what did all of these have in common? The answers very simple - they just started with
one product and focused on doing it right. Sure we now live in the world where Google builds smartphones, speakers, and
YouTube; and Facebook has it's own marketplace, along with WhatsApp messenger, and Instagram; and Uber delivers not only
you but also any food you may want; but none of them started out with that as a goal.  All of them started out, and even
made their name, by just doing one thing well (Google had its original pagerank algorithm, Facebook a clean and
simplistic networking platform, Uber a simple smartphone based taxi app, and Spotify a free music streaming platform - 
no podcasts, no radio, just music), so well that they were able to monopolise the market in that area to build out 
massive customer bases. Only then did they start diversifying into other areas and markets, by this point they had the 
customers, they had the investment, and they had a stable core product to fall back on - this is why they've been so 
successful, and what my startup didn't get. In fact the startup was trying to diversify itself across every market 
within it's industry, spreading itself, and the technical staff very thin. As a result we had nearly 100 different 
microservices running for all the different products they were trying to sell across all the markets - and that was 
reflected in our AWS bill, but without the client base to pay for it. *If you want to be a successful startup, just 
choose one thing, do it well, scale the customer base, then diversify the product.*
