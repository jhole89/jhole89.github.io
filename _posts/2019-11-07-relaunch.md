So I never really did anything with this website.  As is usual with me, once I learnt something,
I got bored of it.  Im going to try and breathe some new life into this and actually get a proper
blog going.  A lot has changed since I first did this site, most of all my perspective, and as I've 
become more experienced I think I've actually got some points that I need and want to air around the
industry as a whole.  However, before I can do all that, I think a refresh is in order...stay tuned.
